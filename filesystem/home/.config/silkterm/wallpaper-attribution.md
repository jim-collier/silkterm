# Source attribution

Provenance for every image in the collection. Sorted by match confidence, highest first, so settled entries lead and open ones collect at the bottom.

Most of these sit in `010_origs`. The newest ones are staged in `005_new/master` until the next pass moves them across; they are listed here all the same, since the provenance travels with the file rather than the folder.

This was three lists until now - the folder itself, the `@jc` set and the `@tt` set, each in its own subfolder. The images and their tables are merged here. The `@jc` rows were built from the files' own metadata, since that set never had a table of its own.

Each image also carries this information in its own metadata:

- `ObjectName`/`Headline`/`Title` for the title

- `By-line`/`Creator`/`Artist` for the author

- `Credit` and `Source`

- `CopyrightNotice`/`Rights`

- `UsageTerms` for the licence

- `CreatorWorkURL` for the source URL

- `DateCreated`/`DateTimeOriginal` for the original date

- `Caption-Abstract`/`Description` for the comments

- `Instructions` for the provenance trail (original URL, original source filename, original filesystem name, licensed yes/no, match confidence, legal status, and the copyright and rating values that were there before this pass)

- `wallpaper:Fit` and `wallpaper:Anchor` for how the image wants to be laid out, and `wallpaper:Opacity` and `wallpaper:Blur` for how strongly it wants to show - see below

## Layout and look tags

Four XMP fields tell a wallpaper how it should fill a screen that is not its own shape, and how strongly it wants to show. They live in a `wallpaper` namespace (`https://github.com/jim-collier/xmp/wallpaper/1.0/`), named for what they describe rather than for any one program, so other tools can read and write them too.

- `Fit` is `zoom` or `stretch`. `zoom` fills the screen while keeping the aspect ratio and crops the overhang; `stretch` distorts to fit exactly and never crops.

- `Anchor` is `<horizontal>%, <vertical>%` - 0% is left/top, 100% is right/bottom. It picks which part of the image survives a `zoom` crop, and is ignored under `stretch`. Everything here is `50%, 50%`.

`zoom` is the safe default and is what anything with a real subject gets: people, animals, plants, planets, a brand mark, or circles and squares that would read as squashed. `stretch` is for the images with nothing in them to distort - gradients, stripes, blurs, soft abstracts.

- `Opacity` and `Blur` are each a percentage of the viewer's own setting, not an absolute. `100%` means "as configured"; `50%` halves it and `200%` doubles it. A busy image can ask to sit quieter, or a soft gradient to skip most of the blur, without deciding for the viewer what the sliders mean. Everything here is `100%`.

## Legend

1. **%**: confidence that the match to the named original source is correct. 90+ means an identifier in the filename resolved directly to a source page, or the file is original work carrying its own provenance. 50-89 means strong corroboration (a watermark, a signature, a credit carried by an intermediary) but no single decisive link. Below 50 is informed inference. 0 means no source was found and the row records only what the image is.

2. **Stars**: the star rating written into each file, with the legality confidence it came from in brackets. See below.

3. **Free w/ attrib?**: explicitly free to use with attribution.

4. **Free free?**: explicitly free to use with or without attribution.

5. **Licensed?**: a licence for non-commercial use has been obtained. This is `N` for everything not already public domain or original work; nothing was purchased or requested as part of this pass.

6. **Fit**: the layout tag written into the file. See above.

`?` in the three licence columns means the terms could not be established, which is not the same as permissive - treat it as unresolved.

## Ratings

The star rating encodes "legality confidence": how confident it is that using the image is legally permitted - mapped proportionally onto 1 to 5. It is not a quality rating and it is not the match confidence in the first column; a file can be certainly identified and still certainly unusable.

The scale is anchored at 25% for 1 star and 100% for 5 stars. Values here run 25% to 100%. Every rating that was in place before this pass is preserved in each file's `Instructions`.

| Stars | Meaning |
|:-:|---|
| 5 | Free licence, public domain, original work with permissive license - use and redistribution permitted |
| 4 | Free licence with conditions (non-commercial, share-alike) - use permitted |
| 3 | Published as a downloadable wallpaper by a named rights holder; personal use reasonable, redistribution not granted |
| 2 | Terms not established, or a vendor/brand asset carrying no licence grant |
| 1 | Explicitly prohibited, paid-only, or third-party character IP |

The two artist sets behave differently from the rest. Their licence is granted rather than guessed at, so what varies is how firmly each file is tied to its author and what third-party material sits inside the artwork - a licence from an artist covers that artist's own composition and cannot grant anyone else's rights. The `@jc` files that drop to 2 stars are the ones built over someone else's material (a screensaver, a stock background, virtual panoramas created from in-game screenshots), not files with a weak attribution.

Most of the non-'@' branded images are 2 stars. For the majority of these files the terms were never established in spite of a good deal of effort made, often due to dead URLs from reverse image searches. The earliest *live* hits are almost always wallpaper aggregators with permissive license terms.

## Least usable

No 1-star files remain here - all four have been moved out. The floor is 2 stars.

Vendor and brand assets (Razer, vivo, Xiaomi) sit at 2 stars rather than 1: the scale reserves 1 star for material that is explicitly prohibited or carries a third-party mark, while an unlicensed vendor asset is only unestablished. That distinction is what kept them here.

The 2-star `@jc` files are a different case again - the composition is Author's work and the licence is real, but each is built over material someone else owns, so the grant does not reach the whole image.

## Most usable

5 stars - free licence, public domain, or original work. Thirty files:

- The eighteen `@jc` originals - seven photographs and two POV-Ray renders under CC BY 4.0, plus six generated images and a 2013 composite. Six of the generated ones are CC0.

- The four `@tt` generated images - CC0 1.0. `two cattle dogs` is the only one with nothing third-party in it at all; the two beach scenes carry a third-party character and a third-party vehicle design, which CC0 does not reach.

- `Blue Marble; astro; Earth, South America closer; @jc enhance.jpg` (95%) - NASA public domain.

- `Blue Marble; astro; Earth, South America; @jc enhance.jpg` (95%) - NASA public domain.

- `DeviantArt; FabioMorales9999; Flatxfce.jpg` (95%) - CC BY 3.0.

- `ESO; M Kornmesser; Mars Four Billion Years Ago.jpg` (95%) - CC BY 4.0.

- `NASA; Juno; Jupiter 2018-10-29.jpg` (100%) - NASA media usage policy - public domain, no permission required.

- `NOIRLab; N A Sharp; High Resolution Solar Spectrum.jpg` (95%) - CC BY 4.0.

- `Unsplash; Daniele Levis Pelusi; Rainbow_1.jpg` (95%) - Unsplash License.

- `Van Gogh; The Starry Night.jpg` (100%) - Public domain.

4 stars - free licence with conditions. Twenty-five files:

- The twenty `@tt` images under CC BY-SA 4.0. Attribution is required and adaptations must carry the same licence.

- `DeviantArt; BlackDiamondOne; Seven Colors.jpg` (85%) - CC BY-NC-ND 3.0.

- `DeviantArt; Kryuko; Debian Darkness.jpg` (85%) - CC BY-NC-ND 3.0.

- `DeviantArt; LunarPixel; Lonery.jpg` (85%) - CC BY-NC-ND 3.0.

- `DeviantArt; MoodyBlue; Stock 12.jpg` (85%) - CC BY-NC-SA 3.0.

- `DeviantArt; nirklars; Red Dwarf Dreams 3.jpg` (85%) - CC BY-NC 3.0.

## Open

- `Razer; Rainbow Spectrum` carries a `WALLPAPERSWIDE.COM` watermark, so this copy came through that aggregator. A clean original is on razer.com/wallpapers, which would settle both the watermark and the provenance.

- `unknown; light streaks` - authorship is unresolved. The original filename carried a capture stamp and an iPhone 7, which reads like original work, but it's not. Unknown.

- `@jc; art; rainbow gradient` carries an own-work claim but no metadata came with the file, and its original name (`0053.jpg`) belongs to the numbered unattributed batch here. The claim may be wrong.

- The four Alphacoders files record only who uploaded them, never who made them. That chain does not lead anywhere, so their originals would have to be found some other way. (Most reverse-image search to earliest links that 404, with next earliest links being permissive wallpaper sites.)

- The locally numbered files and several hash-named files have no recoverable provenance - re-hosting stripped it before they were saved.

- `Marina Dolgopolova; autumn lake shore` - the credit came from the aggregator rather than from the artist, so it is reported, not verified.

- Fifteen `@tt` files carry no credit inside them; the attribution rests on the filename prefix plus a confirmation. That is the same class of evidence that misattributed a Microsoft wallpaper here, so it is recorded as 85% rather than treated as settled.

- `@tt; win; 2015; 10; dark teal` carried `all rights reserved` in its own pre-pass metadata.

- `@tt; art; abstract; color streaks` has an unknown author under it. The CC BY-SA grant covers the compositing work, not the base image.

- Much of the `@tt` set is built around Microsoft, Arch, Ubuntu and Apple marks. The licence covers the composition; the marks belong to their owners and are not licensed by it. This matters for redistribution, not for private use.

## Moved out

Nineteen files were removed as legally problematic and their rows dropped from the table above. Each still carries its own provenance metadata, so nothing was lost.

- Eleven DeviantArt all-rights-reserved entries.

- `InterfaceLIFT; After Rain` - personal use only, site retired.

- `Microsoft; Office; world map, orange`, `Microsoft; Windows Vista; Grass`, `Microsoft; Plus 95; Science, lunar surface with splatter` - bundled or promotional Microsoft assets, no redistribution licence.

- `Razer; Chroma Crystals` - brand asset carrying an aggregator watermark.

- `WallpaperFlare; Windows 95 logo`, `unknown; win; Windows 8 logo, red`, `unknown; win; Windows logo, sepia 3D relief` - third-party marks.
